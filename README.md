📚 Course Recommendation System Using Big Data 🌐
This project implements a Course Recommendation System using Big Data tools and technologies. It processes large datasets to provide personalized course recommendations based on user preferences and ratings.

🚀 Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure the following tools are installed and configured:

🗃️ Hadoop & HDFS: For distributed data storage.
⚡ PySpark: For data processing and implementing the ALS algorithm for recommendations.
📦 Cassandra: For storing user data and recommendations.
🐍 Python: For data cleaning and backend scripting.
🌐 Flask: For creating the backend API.
🎨 HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the frontend interface.
🔧 Tools and Technologies Used
Hadoop: Stores large datasets in a distributed manner with high availability.
PySpark (MLlib): Processes data and trains the ALS (Alternating Least Squares) model for course recommendations.
Pandas: Cleans and prepares data before processing.
Cassandra: Stores user information and recommendations for fast retrieval.
Flask: Manages API requests and serves the recommendation results.
Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS): Provides a user-friendly interface to input user IDs and display recommendations.
💡 About the Project
This project combines the power of Big Data technologies to create a scalable, efficient, and user-centric course recommendation system. The use of distributed storage (HDFS), scalable processing (PySpark), and fast querying (Cassandra) ensures seamless handling of large datasets and real-time recommendations.

While the system delivers accurate and personalized results, future enhancements can focus on improving the user interface and exploring additional algorithms for better recommendations. 🚀📈
