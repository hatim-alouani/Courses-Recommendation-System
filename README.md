This project implements a Course Recommendation System using Big Data tools and technologies. It processes large datasets to provide personalized course recommendations based on user preferences and ratings.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure the following tools are installed and configured:

Hadoop & HDFS: For distributed data storage.
PySpark: For data processing and implementing the ALS algorithm for recommendations.
Cassandra: For storing user data and recommendations.
Python: For data cleaning and backend scripting.
Flask: For creating the backend API.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the frontend interface.
Tools and Technologies Used
Hadoop: Stores large datasets in a distributed manner with high availability.
PySpark (MLlib): Processes data and trains the ALS (Alternating Least Squares) model for course recommendations.
Pandas: Cleans and prepares data before processing.
Cassandra: Stores user information and recommendations for fast retrieval.
Flask: Manages API requests and serves the recommendation results.
Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS): Provides a user-friendly interface to input user IDs and display recommendations.

This project combines the power of Big Data technologies to create a scalable, efficient, and user-centric course recommendation system. The use of distributed storage (HDFS), scalable processing (PySpark), and fast querying (Cassandra) ensures seamless handling of large datasets and real-time recommendations. While the system delivers accurate and personalized results, future enhancements can focus on improving the user interface and exploring additional algorithms for better recommendations.
